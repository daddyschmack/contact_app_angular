# Project Name

This is my interview project for Inmar.  I had to relearn Angular in the last 3 days, so the javascript will probably not be as impressive
as if I used a more familiar javascript tool.  There are a couple bugs, and I could do lot more with the interface.  Please feel free to send me
a more challenging presentation test.  

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple.  
Step 1. Downlaod the file

You have two choices at this point.  
If you have npm and gulp installed, 
just go to the project root, in your console and type "npm -install"
After everything is downlaoded and installed, type "gulp default" in your console at the project root.
Then navigate to http: localhost:3000/public/index.html


If you have a different server, put the directory on you server and navigate to:

http://yourserverURL:somePort/public/index.html


Or for the super easy way, just go to this url:

https://jj-contacts-example.firebaseio.com


Known Bugs:
If you enter edit mode by clicking on a field, you have to leave the email field to turn it off for that row.  

Sometimes, it creates a blank row.  I thought I had that fixed, but I spent enough time on a 4-6 hr project.  
(I would of course fix that before putting it out to a client or release it to the wild.)
